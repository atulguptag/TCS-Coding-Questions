Q1. An organization is conducting eye checkup camp, the number of people allowed for registration is 10. A person is supposed to enter his age for registration. If a senior citizen above 60yrs age registers then he is shifted to another queue which will be 2nd queue, now two separate queues are created for checkup. The 2nd queue will be for senior citizens. 

If the number of people in the 2nd queue becomes 5 then shifting of senior citizens from 1st queue to 2nd queue is stopped. Suppose eye checkup takes approximately 15 mins per person, then calculate the total number of time taken for checkup by fits queue and second queue respectively. 

Number of person Registrations 'N' for checkup,

1<=N<=10 Age of person,'A'

10<=A<=100

Note:

1. Output should be in the format:

    QUEUE1 TIME: <'integer'> mins

    QUEUE2 TIME: <'integer'> mins

If age is below 10 or above 100 display "INVALID INPUT"
